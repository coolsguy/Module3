Module 3 - Pseudocode
	//Calculate Average Withholding

	//Start off with a few variables and a scanner class to accept the input of the user's income
	Scanner
	double income
	double for each tax Bracket Rate = .90 (.90 will be multiplied by the input value in order to get the result after the tax is withheld)
	double for each tax Bracket Result = income * each bracket rate relating to which result (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)

	//some if statements to determine the ranges of income
	if gross income < 500
		then print "Net income" + firstBracketResult
	if gross income >= 500 AND income < 1500
		then print "Net income" + secondBracketResult
	//and so on
